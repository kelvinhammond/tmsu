HIGH

E Don't detect modification of directory entries themselves.
E Make '--recursive' a global option to allow it to be used in aliases.

E Add unit-tests for each command.
E Issue #29: Option to allow just files or directories to be listed.
B virtual file-system slow when lots of files: appears to be related to the file counts.
B 'tmsu tags' should report error for arguments that exist neither on disk nor database.
B 'status' command is not reporting untagged files in tagged directories when run without arguments.
B 'repair' command does not handle the case where a previously tagged file is replaced with a directory (and vice versa).
E Issue #33: provide binary for 64 bit Linux.

MEDIUM

E 'tmsu tag' should bulk add files and then bulk add taggings.

E Consolidate 'status' and 'repair' commands.
E Add benchmarks.
C Rename 'filetag' to 'tagging'.
E Issue #35: print0 support.

HIGH

B 'repair' command does not always identify moved files.
    * If an explicitly tagged file './a' is moved under an explicitly tagged
      directory './b', then the file './b/a' is identified as an added file
      rather than a move of file './a'. The repair should update the path of
      the existing file and add additional implict taggings from its new parent
      directory.
    * Moving a file './c/d' to './d' should remove the implicit taggings
      inherited from './c' but keep any explicit taggings.
B Command line options that take an argument do not work properly.
E Use fmt.Errorf rather than just propagating existing errors.
E Add unit-tests for each command.
B Untagging via the VFS does not remove implicit taggings.
E Storage level operations should ensure database consistency. E.g. deleting a
  tag should result in corresponding taggings being deleted.
B 'repair' command does not handle the case where a previously tagged
  file is replaced with a directory (and vice versa).

MEDIUM

E Consolidate 'status' and 'repair' commands.
B 'tmsu tags a' should report files that exist neither on disk nor database.

E Issue #29: Option to allow just files or directories to be listed.
E Add benchmarks.
C Rename 'filetag' to 'tagging'.

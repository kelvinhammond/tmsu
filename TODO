HIGH

B 'repair' command does not always identify moved files.
    * If an explicitly tagged file './a' is moved under an explicitly tagged directory './b', then the file './b/a' is identified as an added file rather than a move of file './a'. The repair should update the path of the existing file and add additional implict taggings from its new parent directory.
    * Moving a file './c/d' to './d' should remove the implicit taggings inherited from './c' but keep any explicit taggings.  B Command line options that take an argument do not work properly.  E Use fmt.Errorf rather than just propagating existing errors.
E Add unit-tests for each command.
B 'tmsu tags' should report error for arguments that exist neither on disk nor database.
E Issue #29: Option to allow just files or directories to be listed.
E 'tmsu tag' should bulk add files and then bulk add taggings.
B Untagging via the VFS does not remove implicit taggings.
E Storage level operations should ensure database consistency. E.g. deleting a tag should result in corresponding taggings being deleted.
B 'repair' command does not handle the case where a previously tagged file is replaced with a directory (and vice versa).
B 'tmsu untag file x' command reports file is not tagged 'x' if file is implicitly tagged 'x'.

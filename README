Overview
--------

tmsu is an application that allows you to organise your files by associating
them with tags. It provides a tool for managing these tags and a virtual file-
system to allow tag based access to your files.

tmsu's virtual file-system does not store your files: it merely provides an
alternative, tagged based view of your files stored elsewhere in the file-
system. That way you have the freedom to choose the most suitable file-system
for storage whilst still benefiting from tag based access.

Usage
-----

A command overview and details on how to use each command are available via the
integrated help:

    > tmsu help

Full documentation is maintained online at http://bitbucket.org/oniony/tmsu.

Compiling
---------

The following steps are for compiling from source. Compiled binaries for some
platforms are available from the tmsu project page on Bitbucket.

tmsu is written in Go (http://www.golang.org/). To compile from source you
must first install Go and the packages that tmsu depends upon.

1. Installing Go

Go can be installed per the instructions at http://golang.org/doc/install.html
or it may be available in the package management system that comes with your
operating system (if any).

tmsu is currently built against the Go weekly builds (see `VERSIONS` for exact
revision numbers).

2. Install the dependent packages

    > goinstall github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
    > goinstall github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/fuse

At the time of writing the go-fuse project does not have a Makefile so must
be compiled manually:

    > cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/hanwen/go-fuse
    > ./all.bash

3. Checkout the tmsu source code:

    > hg co https://bitbucket.org/oniony/tmsu

4. Make the project

    > cd tmsu
    > make

This will compile to 'bin/tmsu' within the working directory.

5. Install the project

    > sudo make install

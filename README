Overview
--------

tmsu is an application that allows you to organise your files by associating
them with tags. It provides a tool for managing these tags and a virtual file-
system to allow tag based access to your files.

tmsu's virtual file-system does not store your files: it merely provides an
alternative, tagged based view of your files stored elsewhere in the file-
system. That way you have the freedom to choose the most suitable file-system
for storage whilst still benefiting from tag based access.

Usage
-----

A command overview and details on how to use each command are available via the
integrated help:

    > tmsu help

Full documentation is maintained online in the tmsu wiki:

Downloading
-----------

Binary builds for a limited number of architectures and operating system
combinations are available on the project's download page:

  http://bitbucket.org/oniony/tmsu/downloads

Compiling
---------

The following steps are for compiling from source. Compiled binaries for some
platforms are available from the tmsu project page on Bitbucket.

tmsu is written in the Go programming language. To compile from source you must
first install Go and the packages that tmsu depends upon. You can get that from
the Go website:

  http://www.golang.org/

1. Installing Go

Go can be installed per the instructions on the Go website or it may be
available in the package management system that comes with your operating
system.

tmsu is currently built against the Go weekly builds. See VERSIONS for the
latest version that is known to work with the dependent packages.

2. Install the dependent packages.

    (See VERSIONS file for which revisions work together.)

    > go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
    > go get github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/fuse

3. Checkout the tmsu source code:

    > hg co https://bitbucket.org/oniony/tmsu

4. Make the project

    > cd tmsu
    > make

This will compile to 'bin/tmsu' within the working directory.

5. Install the project

    > sudo make install

This will install tmsu to /usr/bin/tmsu.

Overview
--------

tmsu is an application that allows you to organise your files by associating
them with tags. It provides a tool for managing these tags and a virtual file-
system to allow tag based access to your files.

tmsu's virtual file system does not store your files: it merely provides an
alternative, tagged based view of your files stored elsewhere in the file-
system. That way you have the freedom to choose the most suitable file system
for storage whilst still benefiting from tag based access.

Usage
-----

A command overview and details on how to use each command are available via the
integrated help:

  $ tmsu help

Full documentation is maintained online in the tmsu wiki:

  http://bitbucket.org/oniony/tmsu/wiki

Downloading
-----------

Binary builds for a limited number of architectures and operating system
combinations are available on the project's download page:

  http://bitbucket.org/oniony/tmsu/downloads

You will need to ensure that both FUSE and Sqlite3 are installed for the
program to function.

Compiling
---------

The following steps are for compiling from source.

1. Installing Go

tmsu is written in the Go programming language. To compile from source you must
first install Go and the packages that tmsu depends upon. You can get that from
the Go website:

  http://www.golang.org/

Go can be installed per the instructions on the Go website or it may be
available in the package management system that comes with your operating
system.

tmsu is currently built against the Go weekly builds. See VERSIONS for the
latest version that is known to work with the dependent packages.

2. Install the dependent packages.

  $ go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
  $ go get github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/fuse

Presently go-fuse does not compile automatically when retrieved with 'go get'
so it is necessary to build it manually:

  a. Change to the go-fuse source directory:

    $ cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/hanwen/go-fuse

  b. Edit the all.bash script and change both occurances of 'go-fuse/${d}'
  to 'github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/${d}'.

  c. Change the permissions of all.bash to make it executable:

    $ chmod a+x all.bash

  d. Run the build:

    $ ./all.bash

3. Clone the tmsu respository:

  $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/oniony/tmsu

4. Make the project

  $ cd tmsu
  $ make

This will compile to 'bin/tmsu' within the working directory.

5. Install the project

  $ sudo make install

This will install tmsu to /usr/bin/tmsu.
It will also install the Zsh completion to /usr/share/zsh/site-functions.

To change the paths used override the environment variables in the Makefile.

About
-----

The project website is at:

  http://www.tmsu.org/

There is a tmsu mailing list which can be used for asking questions, making
suggestions, reporting bugs, &c. Release announcements are also made on this
list.

  http://groups.google.com/group/tmsu

tmsu is written in Go. For more information visit:

  http://www.golang.org/.

tmsu itself is written and maintained by Paul Ruane <paul@tmsu.org>, however
much of the functionality it provides is made possible by the Fuse and Sqlite3
libraries, their Go bindings and, of course, the Go language standard library.

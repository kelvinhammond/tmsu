0.0.6
-----

IMPORTANT

Version 0.0.6 makes a schema change to the database to record the modification
timestamp for files. The new code will not work with an existing tmsu database
until it has been upgraded.

To upgrade the database, run the upgrade script using the Sqlite3 tooling:

    $ sqlite3 -init misc/db-upgrade/0.0.5_to_0.0.6.sql

It is also advisable to run 'repair' after upgrading which will populate the
new column and also fix the directory fingerprints which have a new algorithm.

CHANGES

* Upgraded to Go 1.
* Added 'repair' command to fix up database when files are moved or modified.
* Added 'version' command.
* Added 'copy' command (duplicates a tag).
* Added modification timestamp which is used in preference to fingerprint.
* Command output now includes 'tmsu' to make it clear where output is coming from when piping.
* Relative paths now calculated more accurately.
* Zsh completion now supports tags containing colons.
* 'status' command performance and functionality improvements.
* Added directory fingerprinting.
* Added 'repair' command to Zsh completion.
